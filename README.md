# TIYO Assistant

This is a chrome extension to assist with The Iron Yard Online for instructors. Since this is not (yet?) a distributed extension, you will need to clone this repo (or download it) in order to use it.

## To Use

First install the Grunt CLI if you don't have it already, then clone the repo, install dependencies, and build the project!

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ git clone git@github.com:TIYDC/tiyo-assistant.git && cd tiyo-assistant && npm install && grunt
```

Don't forget to [enable developer extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01) in Chrome, then go to [your extensions](chrome://extensions/) and click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and navigate to the directory you cloned this repo into.
